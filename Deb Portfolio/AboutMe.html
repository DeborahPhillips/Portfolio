Hi! My name is Deborah. I am passionate about making the most of every opportunity to improve,
develop and grow in my personal/professional life. Instructional design, teaching, program management, and Human Resources are part of my wheelhouse.</p> 
<p>
Some of the curriculum that I have developed is training material for emergency prepardness, public relations modules, and business curriculum for new start
ups. I have taught adult education courses, lead group meetings in rehabilitation centers and have developed curriculum for exercise machines to be taught to customer
service agents. 
Design has been a part of my life in many ways. Some of the other ways that I have used design is through creating marketing materials such as business cards, brouchures, fliers and 
and banners. I have used these skills as a Marketing Director, Advertising Executive and Program Manager.
Through my work experiences, interactions with colleagues and working one-on-one with clients I have come to better understand
the world around me and the importance of being open to change.
