	<h3>BATC Business Curriculm for Start Ups</h3><p class="font_s">
	I had the opportunity to develop curriculum for BATC for one of my classes in Instructional Technology and Learning Sciences. At the end of the course, I realized that we had only developed a small module and the rest of the business module was
going to be left unfinished. I reached out to Mason Lefler, who we had worked with orginially, and I asked if I could volunteed to finish out the all of the business course. He was happy to all me to do so. It has 
been a tremendous opportunity for me to learn, but more importantly for me to give back to BATC.

	<h3>The Importance of Volunteerism</h3><p class="font_s">
This video that I chose to place in this section does a great job if telling my story. Volunteering is really important to me. I believe in giving back, supporting others and more importantly giving others a hand up.
