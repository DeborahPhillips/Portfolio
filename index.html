<h1>Hi my name is Deborah Phillips!</h1>
<p class="font_s"> I am currently finishing my doctorate in Instructional Technology and Learning Sciences (ITLS) at Utah State University. I will finish with my dissertation in Spring of 2021. 
This portfolio is to further introduce me, my resume and experience, current research, and some of my volunteer work.
</p>
<p>
The pieces of my puzzle are my work <a href="Resume.html">experience</a>, my <a href="Resume.html">education</a>, my <a href="Projects.html">projects</a>, and my areas of interest in <a href="Volunteerism.html">volunteerism</a>.
I am passionate about making the most of every opportunity to improve, develop, and grow in my personal and professional life. Instructional design, teaching, program management, and Human Resources are parts of my <a href="Resume.html">wheelhouse.</a></p> 
<p>
I have developed curriculum training material for emergency preparedness, public relation modules, and business curriculum for new start-ups. 
I have taught adult education courses, lead group meetings in rehabilitation centers, and have developed curriculum for exercise machines to be taught to customer
service agents. 
Design has been a part of my life in many ways. Along with the examples above, I have used design by creating marketing materials, such as business cards, brouchures, fliers, and banners. 
I have used these skills as a Marketing Director, Advertising Executive, and Program Manager.
Through my work experiences, interactions with colleagues and working one-on-one with clients, I have come to better understand the world around me and the importance of being open to and excited about change.
