		Utah State University Scholastic Media Awards is a one day event for high school students to come and participate 
in classes such as Public Relations, Social Media, Media Law, Broadcast and News Writing. I have created my research around this program to answer a few key questions.
One being "how does extra-curricular activities affect the decision of high school students to attend a particular university?" and "How do these activities impact their career goals?" These along with 
other questions will be answered through this research.
